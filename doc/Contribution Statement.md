Summary: Our analysis offers temporal and geospatial insights for various types of disasters. With this app, insurance companies would be able to tailor premiums based on historical and regional risks, while real estate developers can make informed investment decisions. The tourism sector can strategically plan and deploy their programs, while individual businesses can fortify or reduce supply chains according to the disaster trends offered by our analysis. Not only does the analysis aid the preparatory measures, but also unveils new market opportunities. For example, tech companies can innovate disaster-centric solutions, and healthcare sectors could preemptively stock essential supplies.


[Contribution Statement] All team members contributed to designing the study, developing a solid baseline of the project. After planning out a structure, Shaohuan Wu worked on data retrieval and cleansing, as well as final Shiny App updates. Jason Cho and Manan Brahmbhatt worked on the analysis of disaster data by time. Hannah Gao and Han Wang worked on the geospatial analysis of disaster data. Shaohuan Wu prepared the presentation while team members provided the details of the codes they have worked on.
