# Project 2: Shiny App Analysis

## Geographical Analysis README

In the geographical part, we use the Disaster dataset and plot incident report by types on the US map to show which state has more incidents and further analysis can be built upon the map. 

### Selection Option

From the select box on the left, different disaster types can be chosen in order to see the number of inident happened across the country. 

### Analysis

On the right side, the US map shows the states that report that type of incident and the counts of it by color. For example, when choosing Flood, it can be seen that Northern states are most affected with 600 and more counts of flood incidents.

### Conclusion

This geographical tool has easy function to select different types of disasters and shows the results directly and clearly on map, providing users with meaningful insights from the dataset.
