About geographics:
We have calculated the number of different types of disasters in each state, and the shading represents the frequency of disaster occurrences.
We can clearly see the geographical variations in different natural disasters, for example, flood disasters are mainly concentrated in the region around the five Great Lakes in the north, while snowstorms are mainly concentrated in the northeastern part of the United States. Through such geographical analysis, the government can proactively deploy disaster relief supplies in the heavily affected areas, thereby avoiding the waste of manpower and resources.

About time analysis:
First, we have conducted a yearly analysis of the number of different types of disasters. This allows us to analyze the trends in future disasters. For example, the number of hurricane occurrences has increased sharply in recent years, indicating the need for strengthened preventive measures.
Next, we have performed a monthly analysis. You can use the slider to select a specific year and view the number of disaster occurrences for each month in that year. This feature is particularly helpful for seasonal analysis of disasters.

We can also combine the two parts so that we can find something interesting. For example, it is possible to predict regions and seasons where certain disasters are more likely to occur. Take hurricane for instance. By observing the data, we can identify a higher frequency of hurricanes in the southeastern region during the autumn season. This information can be used to alert residents to take early preventive measures.
