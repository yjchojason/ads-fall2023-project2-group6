# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### Data folder

The data directory contains the data which the group used in the project. 'DisasterDeclarationsSummaries.csv' contains the original data. After data cleaning, 'Disaster_data.csv' and 'MajorDisaster_data.csv' are the datasets which the group used in the shiny app.
